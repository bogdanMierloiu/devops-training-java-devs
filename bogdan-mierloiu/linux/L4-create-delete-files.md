`touch` file_name -> create a file with the name "file_name"

works with touchmy{001..100}file -> create 100 files with the same name and a number at the end

ls part_of_the_file_name* -> list all files that contain "part_of_the_file_name" in their name

ls part_of_the_file_nam? -> list all files that contain "part_of_the_file_nam" in their name and have one character after that

works same for rm / rm part_of_the_file_name* / rm part_of_the_file_nam?
